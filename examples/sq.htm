</p><p>Murphy commented that "Sierra was in a mindset where everything was medieval and it was all fairly serious. I wanted to do a game that was more fun. We even liked the idea of 'fun death'! I mean, if the player is gonna die or fail, they should at least get a laugh out of it. So we came up with the idea of making death amusing. Let's face it, most adventure games involve a good deal of frustration for the player. But we felt that if we made failure fun, to an extent, you might have players actually going back and looking for new ways to die, just to see what happens!"[<i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]

<h2>Roger Wilco[<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Quest&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2" title="Edit section: Roger Wilco">edit</a>]</h2>
<p><b>Roger Wilco</b> is a fictional character and the protagonist of the <i>Space Quest</i> series, introduced in <i>Space Quest: The Sarien Encounter</i> in 1986. Roger is a bumbling if well-meaning <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyman" title="Everyman">everyman</a> character, a spacefaring janitor who has a tendency to attract trouble and stumble into dangerous or interesting situations. Despite saving the universe on multiple occasions, he seems unable to gain any respect from society, and works as a "sanitation engineer" (in one form or another) throughout the series.
</p><p>The character's name is a reference to <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_procedure" title="Voice procedure">voice procedure</a>, one of many puns in the series (it means "receiving you, will comply"). The first two <i>Space Quest</i> games allowed the player to choose the character's name, which defaulted to Roger Wilco if left blank. This feature was later removed in the <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_remake" title="Video game remake">remake</a> of the first game.
</p><p>Roger is originally a janitor from the planet Xenon of the Earnon system. We first meet him as the janitor and sole survivor of the scientific research ship <i>Arcada</i>, which was overrun by the apparently hostile Sariens. After several extremely deadly adventures and a bit of janitorial work, he enters the StarCon Academy. Graduating in <i>Space Quest V</i>, he is promoted from a janitor to captain of the garbage scow <i>SCS Eureka</i>. He also meets Beatrice Creakworm Wankmeister, with whom he becomes romantically involved. In <i>Space Quest 6</i>, his spot in the limelight ends as he is busted back down to janitor and assigned to the backwoods of the cosmos.
</p><p>According to <i>Space Quest IV</i>, Roger would eventually marry Beatrice and they would have a son (Roger Wilco Jr.) who would later travel back in time to save Roger's life. Beatrice is absent from <i>Space Quest 6</i>, but she is mentioned in the game's closing credits and by Roger himself. By the time of the fictional <i>Space Quest XII</i>, when Roger Jr. would be a young adult, Roger would be "unavailable" for some reason. The details are never disclosed.
</p><p>While Roger retains his basic appearance and sustains no lasting damage from his <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swashbuckling" title="Swashbuckling">swashbucklings</a> and repeated near-mutilations, his hair begins the series brown and changes to <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blond" title="Blond">blonde</a> in the upgrade between parts <i>III</i> and <i>IV</i>. (The same has happened to fellow adventure protagonists <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guybrush_Threepwood" title="Guybrush Threepwood">Guybrush Threepwood</a> and <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Aidendale" title="Devon Aidendale">Devon Aidendale</a>, in Devon's case to the other direction.) While this <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retcon" title="Retcon">retcon</a> is never addressed in the game itself, it spawned a full-fledged fangame, <i>Space Quest: The Lost Chapter</i>.<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpace_Quest&amp;rut=49cd47364c769ff996afbe485ee6afbd1266a96b57c6dd69c62c7ccb070b32cc#cite_note-Tringham2014-2">[2]</a>

<p>The original <i>Space Quest</i> game was released in October 1986 and quickly became a hit, selling in excess of 100,000 copies (sales are believed to be around 200,000 to date, not including the many compilations it has been included in). A remake was released in 1991 as <i>Space Quest I: Roger Wilco in the Sarien Encounter</i>.

<h3><i>Space Quest II: Vohaul's Revenge</i>[<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Quest&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5" title="Edit section: Space Quest II: Vohaul&#39;s Revenge">edit</a>]</h3>

<p>Released in 1987; Roger, with his newfound status of Hero, is transferred to the Xenon Orbital Station 4 and promoted to head (and only) janitor. All is quiet until he is abducted by Sludge Vohaul, who was behind the original Sarien attack of the <i>Arcada</i>. As Roger is being transported to the Labion labour mines as punishment for thwarting Sludge's original plan, the prison ship crash-lands in a nearby jungle upon the planet. Our hero manages to escape his pursuers and the dangers of the Labion jungle and soon reaches Sludge's asteroid base. Once again, it's up to Roger alone to stop Vohaul's evil plan: to eradicate sentient life from Xenon by launching millions of cloned insurance salesmen at the planet.

<p>Released in 1989; Roger's escape pod from the end of <i>SQII</i> is captured by an automated garbage freighter. He escapes the robot-controlled scow by repairing an old ship, the <i>Aluminum Mallard</i> (a play on <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Hughes" title="Howard Hughes">Howard Hughes</a>' "<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spruce_Goose" title="Spruce Goose">Spruce Goose</a>" and <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a>'</i> <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>).

<p>Released in 1991; in this installment, Roger embarks on a time-travel adventure through <i>Space Quest</i> games both real and fictional. A reborn Sludge Vohaul from the fictional <i>Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II</i> chases Roger through time in an attempt to finally kill him. Roger also visits settings from the fictional <i>Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros</i> (whose title is a parody of <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom" title="Infocom">Infocom</a>'s game <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leather_Goddesses_of_Phobos" title="Leather Goddesses of Phobos">Leather Goddesses of Phobos</a></i>) and from <i>Space Quest I</i>; in the latter, the graphics and music revert to the style of the original game and Roger is threatened by a group of monochromatic bikers who consider Roger's 256 colors pretentious (or comment on other graphics modes if played in EGA or monochrome).
</p><p>The games <i>Space Quest XII: Vohaul's Revenge II</i> and <i>Space Quest X: Latex Babes of Estros</i> were never actually developed or released as full games, they exist only internally in <i>Space Quest IV</i>.
</p>
<h3><i>Space Quest V: Roger Wilco - The Next Mutation</i>[<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Quest&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8" title="Edit section: Space Quest V: Roger Wilco - The Next Mutation">edit</a>]</h3>

<p>Released in 1993; in <i>Space Quest V</i>, Roger is now a cadet in the StarCon academy. He graduates (or rather, cheats through the final exam) and is appointed captain of his own spacecraft (actually a space garbage scow). The main plot is to stop a mutagenic disease that is spreading through the galaxy by discovering its source, and fighting everyone that got infected. In the end, the disease infected the crew members of the <i>SCS Goliath</i>, a powerful warship, whose commander, Raemes T. Quirk (a rather blatant spoof of <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T. Kirk">Captain Kirk</a>), subsequently attacks the <i>Eureka</i>. In the end, Roger sacrifices his ship to get rid of the plague - and suddenly, if temporarily, becomes the commander of the fleet's flagship.
</p><p>Roger's cheating is, along with Raemes T. Quirk, an homage to William Shatner's <i>Star Trek</i> character, who cheated on his own Starfleet exam by reprogramming a "no-win" scenario so that he could successfully complete it. In a typical twist of luck, however, Roger's exam scores are still achieved by accident.
</p><p>This entry was the first in the <i>Space Quest</i> series where only one of the two guys from andromeda, Mark Crowe, lead a <i>Space Quest</i> project, due to the fact that Scott Murphy was working on other projects.
</p>
<h3><i>Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier</i>[<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Space_Quest&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9" title="Edit section: Space Quest 6: Roger Wilco in The Spinal Frontier">edit</a>]</h3>

<p>Released in 1995, this game was the last to be released in the <i>Space Quest</i> series. Having defeated the diabolical pukoid mutants in <i>Space Quest V</i>, Captain Roger Wilco triumphantly returns to StarCon headquarters - only to be court-martialed due to breaking StarCon regulations while saving the galaxy. He's busted down to Janitor Second Class, and assigned to the <i>SCS DeepShip 86</i> (a parody of <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></i>), commanded by Commander <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kielbasa" title="Kielbasa">Kielbasa</a>, a <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowardly_Lion" title="Cowardly Lion">Cowardly Lion</a> look-alike whose name is taken from the Polish sausage as well as being a play on the names of both the feline <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilrathi" title="Kilrathi">Kilrathi</a> from the video game series <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Commander_(franchise)" title="Wing Commander (franchise)">Wing Commander</a> and of the character <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mufasa" title="Mufasa">Mufasa</a> from the animated motion picture <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a>.

The main villain in the game is a wrinkly old lady named Sharpei, a pun on the dog Shar Pei, a wrinkly dog.
</p><p>The game's subtitle comes from the final portion, in which Roger has to undergo miniaturization and enter the body of a shipmate and romantic interest. (This segment also provided the game's original subtitle, <i>Where in Corpsman Santiago is Roger Wilco?</i>, which was not used due to legal threats from the makers of the <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Sandiego_(video_game_series)" title="Carmen Sandiego (video game series)">Carmen Sandiego</a></i> products.)[<i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]
</p><p>Sadly, once again, only one of the Two Guys from Andromeda worked on this game. This time though, it was Scott Murphy who sat in the director's chair, more or less. Scott was actually a co-director of <i>Space Quest 6</i> with another Sierra employee, Josh Mandel, who'd worked on many of the behind-the-scenes aspects of <i>Space Quest IV</i> and <i>V</i>, as well as helping create the SCI remake of <i>King's Quest I</i>. Josh actually worked on and created the majority of <i>Space Quest 6</i>, and had to step out when the project was already near completion, and that's when Scott Murphy just stepped in and did the rest.

<p>In <i>Space Quest IV</i>, Roger travels into both the past and future of the game's timeline. Even in-game characters are <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction" title="Metafiction">conscious of living in a video game</a>, and refer to eras with sequel numbers, not temporal units (such as years), even though specific years are named elsewhere in the <i>Space Quest</i> <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)" title="Canon (fiction)">canon</a>.

</p><p>Development of <i>Space Quest VII</i> was underway in 1996 when Sierra released <i>The Space Quest Collection</i>, which consisted of <i>Space Quest I</i> through <i>6</i> and included a brief trailer of <i>Space Quest VII</i> (consisting of Roger strapping a giant rocket to his back and using it to push himself forward on roller skates in a scene reminiscent of <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wile_E._Coyote" title="Wile E. Coyote">Wile E. Coyote</a>). Little was released regarding story line, interface, et cetera, although there was speculation that the game would introduce a multiplayer aspect. Scott Murphy said during development that <i>Space Quest VII</i> would contain some <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_computer_graphics" title="3D computer graphics">3D</a> elements, but would not require the use of a 3D accelerator card. Due to poor sales of <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grim_Fandango" title="Grim Fandango">Grim Fandango</a></i>, a high-profile adventure game by <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LucasArts" title="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>, there was a perception that humorous adventure games were no longer viable, so when <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi" title="Vivendi">Vivendi</a> took over Sierra, <i>Space Quest VII</i> was cancelled.
</p><p>This project was eventually restarted in 1999, and pitched to management, but ultimately did not have enough support to continue within the company. Few details are known about the <i>SQVII</i> relaunch, save that there was one very ardent supporter, who later left Vivendi.

<p>Another <i>Space Quest</i> began development by Escape Factory for the Microsoft Xbox video game console in 2002, entitled simply <i>Space Quest</i>.
</p><p>This attempt at creating a new <i>Space Quest</i> was announced on February 7, 2002. Development proceeded for almost a year and a half before the project was cancelled. According to <i>Space Quest 6</i> designer Josh Mandel, the <i>SQVII</i> designers were forbidden from using story elements from the original <i>Space Quest</i> games or from even playing the games. This is disputable, since other sources claimed the developers had played the games before. Website FYI.com, also claimed that this "gutted" <i>SQVII</i> would not have been an adventure game at all and would have been released only on game console platforms such as the <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_(console)" title="Xbox (console)">Xbox</a> rather than the PC. Since then the Vivendi's Product Manager Bruce Goodwill, has confirmed that the title was going to be released only on console platforms.
</p><p>The game was planned as a departure from the main <i>Space Quest</i> series, rumors it starred a new character named "Wilger", although Roger Wilco was playable (as seen in a production video). Though it would have maintained a comedic theme in space, no plan was made to connect it to the original series. It was cancelled around 2003.

<p><i>Space Quest</i> merchandise included the <i>Space Quest III</i> <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHS" title="VHS">VHS</a> tape and pin, <i>Space Quest 6</i> mug, calling card and patch and an autographed picture of Roger Wilco.<a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpace_Quest&amp;rut=49cd47364c769ff996afbe485ee6afbd1266a96b57c6dd69c62c7ccb070b32cc#cite_note-http://frostbytei.com-6">[6]</a><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpace_Quest&amp;rut=49cd47364c769ff996afbe485ee6afbd1266a96b57c6dd69c62c7ccb070b32cc#cite_note-spacequest1-7">[7]</a>
</p><p>Two strategy guides were released that contained novelizations of the first five games from Roger Wilco's perspective.
</p><p>The first of these included <i>The Space Quest Companion</i> by Peter and Jeremy Spear. The book is similar to Peter Spear's <i><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King%27s_Quest_Companion" title="The King&#39;s Quest Companion">The King's Quest Companion</a></i> and <i>The Official Uncensored Leisure Suit Larry Bedside Companion</i>. The first edition covered the first four games (with a preview of SQ5), and the second added the fifth game. It was written from the perspective of Roger Wilco sending journals on disks back into the past, so that his adventures could be made into video games so that his great grand parents (x-times removed) would have a chance to meet each other and fall in love through their mutual love of the games. Thus by inspiring the game designers to create the games, he insured his own future existence. Each story began with Roger's daydreams and his fantasies of marrying Cornucopia Agricorp and later Beatrice Wankmeister.
</p><p>The other was <i>The Official Guide To Roger Wilco's Space Adventures</i> by Jill Champion. It is similar to her <i>The Official Book of Police Quest</i>. It came in two editions as well. The book contains two interviews with Roger Wilco (one just after events of <i>SQIV</i>, and the other after <i>SQV</i>). The novels themselves are written as Roger's running monologues during his adventures. The first edition covers <i>SQ</i> EGA to <i>SQIV</i>, and the second edition covers <i>SQI</i> remake to <i>SQV</i>. The novel of SQ1 in the first edition is based on the original SQ1, and the version in the second edition is based on the remake of SQ1.
</p><p><a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Publications" title="Adventure Publications">Adventure Comics</a> (a division of <a href="http://frogfind.com/read.php?a=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malibu_Comics" title="Malibu Comics">Malibu Comics</a>) released three issues in 1992 of a comic based on <i>Space Quest I</i> under the name <i>The Adventures of Roger Wilco</i>. The first was written by John Shaw and was in full colour. The other two were written by Paul O'Connor and were black and white. The print run was very small and the books are very hard to find now.
